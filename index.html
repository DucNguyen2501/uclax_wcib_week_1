      I have worked as a graphic designer for 7 years, from in-house marketing, studio branding to an advertising agency. Every market gives me experiences that help me quickly adapt to a new environment, and now it gives me the motivation to explore the new world, UX design. I'm using Macbook.

      During my first assignment, I didn't understand what the terminal actually used for and I was stuck when they asked me for a password. I had no clue why it required password while Michael didn't mention about it. I started searching my problem on Google but just got disappointments. Observing at Michael's screenshot that shows the name of his computer, it helps me understand the terminal controls my computer and turned out this is my computer's password. And I solved it for the rest of the assignment. Google is my favorite site for searching the solution. Besides, I have other favorite websites are listed below:
